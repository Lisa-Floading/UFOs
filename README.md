## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this deliverable is to update a webpage and dynamic table to provide more detail about UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Table filters for city, state, country, and shape are added to the original code. A table was built using data stored in a JavaScript array. The table is dynamic, responding to user input.
